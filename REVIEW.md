# Distributed Durable Execution Engine — Review and Feedback

## Review contract

Severity:

- P0 — Critical: immediate correctness, security, data-loss, or availability risk that blocks acceptance.
- P1 — High: serious defect or regression with substantial user/system impact; should be fixed before acceptance.
- P2 — Medium: real defect or important test/reliability gap with bounded impact; fix unless explicitly deferred.
- P3 — Low: minor correctness, maintainability, observability, documentation, or test-quality issue that does not block acceptance by itself.

Blocking findings:

- Unresolved P0 and P1 findings always block acceptance.
- An unresolved P2 finding blocks acceptance unless Claude explicitly records it as deferred with a reason and linked follow-up. A deferred P2 remains OPEN; deferral is metadata, not a finding status.
- P3 findings do not block acceptance by themselves.

Finding status lifecycle:

- OPEN — Claude has recorded the finding and it remains unresolved.
- ADDRESSED — Codex has proposed a fix; Claude has not yet verified it.
- DISPUTED — Codex believes the finding is stale or incorrect and has supplied evidence.
- VERIFIED — Claude checked the proposed fix and confirmed the finding is resolved.
- WITHDRAWN — Claude retracts the finding after determining it was incorrect or inapplicable; the withdrawal reason and evidence must be recorded.

The `Status` field directly under each finding is the authoritative current state of that finding. The status inside a `Codex response` records Codex's action for that response, and the status inside a `Claude verification` records Claude's action for that verification step; those subsection fields are an audit trail, not separate competing states. Whenever Codex or Claude records a response or verification, update the finding's top-level `Status` to the resulting current state.

Review verdicts:

- NOT_REVIEWED — No completed Claude review exists for the recorded scope and target.
- CHANGES_REQUESTED — One or more unresolved findings block acceptance of the reviewed scope.
- NO_BLOCKING_FINDINGS — Claude found no unresolved blocking findings for the recorded scope and review basis. Deferred P2 findings, P3 findings, uncertainties, and untested areas may remain and must be stated.

A completed provisional review may use CHANGES_REQUESTED or NO_BLOCKING_FINDINGS, but a provisional review cannot satisfy PLAN.md DONE criteria. Final acceptance requires review of the committed final target.

A handoff with `Task status: READY_FOR_REVIEW` requires `Handoff basis: COMMITTED` and a concrete target commit. A `PROVISIONAL` handoff must remain `IN_PROGRESS`.

## Codex handoff

- Task: M0 foundation (DUR-001 through DUR-004)
- Task status: READY_FOR_REVIEW
- Handoff basis: COMMITTED
- Base commit: `d722cf7`
- Target commit: `ed62eca`
- Scope and implementation summary: Completed the repository/toolchain foundation; corrected the DUR-002 state/attempt contracts and expanded race traces; added shared Go/Python partition vectors with UTF-8 validation; added reusable Go/Python failpoint clients, seeded fake activities, arbitrary-command fault control, early-exit/protocol handling, release acknowledgements, and append-flushed `fault-trace.v1` evidence; fixed runtime image/internal-package copying, migration-ledger skipping, and explicit M0 service-test reporting. Existing PLAN changes were preserved while M0 statuses/evidence were updated. R001 remains open pending explicit authorization of those pre-existing PLAN scope changes.
- Checks run and results:
  - `powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/bootstrap.ps1 -StartServices`: PASS; Go 1.27.1, locked Python environment, pinned Docker builds, migration, and local health smoke passed.
  - `scripts/check.ps1` with task-local Go/uv/temp caches: PASS; Go format/vet/test/build, Ruff, strict mypy, and 11 pytest tests passed.
  - `scripts/restart-smoke.ps1`: PASS; PostgreSQL marker and Kafka marker topic survived forced container recreation.
  - `scripts/ci.ps1`: PASS; default path reported opt-in checks explicitly.
  - `scripts/ci.ps1 -WithRace`: PASS; Go race tests and 11 Python tests passed.
  - `scripts/ci.ps1 -WithRace -WithServices`: PASS; Go race tests, Python tests, PostgreSQL/Kafka smoke, service health, durability settings, and Prometheus scrape checks passed; it explicitly reported that M0 integration tests are not implemented.
  - Partition vectors passed independently in Go and Python; fault controller release acknowledgement, repeated same-seed kills, different-seed fixture fields, early exit, noisy stdout, heavy stderr, timeout, and append-flushed trace tests passed.
- Skipped checks and reasons: No remote CI is configured (`git remote -v` is empty). Model/paid-provider checks are intentionally not part of M0. Final Linux I/O/performance studies are deferred by the plan. `pwsh` was unavailable, so Windows PowerShell was used. The existing `.pytest_cache` and elevated pytest temp ACLs emitted host warnings; fresh task-local paths were used for passing validation. R001 authorization remains pending user confirmation.
- Known limitations: This milestone does not implement durable workflow state, scheduler ownership, Kafka relay semantics, or correctness/performance claims. PostgreSQL/Kafka are a single-node local development topology. Claude round-2 verification remains pending; this handoff is ready for independent review, not DONE.

## Claude review rounds

### Round 1 — 2026-09-16 — M0 foundation (DUR-001 through DUR-004)

- Date and round: 2026-09-16, round 1.
- Review basis: COMMITTED. Working tree was clean at `5184a3d` when the review started.
- Base and target commits: implementation target `87e123a`; handoff commit `5184a3d` (changes only REVIEW.md and docs/BUILD_LOG.md). The handoff declares base `198fd4b`, but the handoff scope includes DUR-001, whose implementation *is* `198fd4b` and had never been reviewed (see R009). DUR-001 files were therefore reviewed against `d722cf7`; DUR-002 through DUR-004 were reviewed as `198fd4b..87e123a`.
- Scope inspected: all files changed in `d722cf7..5184a3d`: PLAN.md (M0 status edits and the pre-existing scope edits committed in `87e123a`), README.md, docs/BUILD_LOG.md, docs/CONTRACTS.md, docs/DECISIONS.md, docs/RUNBOOK.md, docs/partition-map-v1.md, internal/partition/, cmd/runtime/, python/durable_contracts/, python/faults/, python/workers/, scripts/*.ps1, deploy/local/ (Compose, Dockerfiles), migrations/, pyproject.toml, .gitignore/.env.example, and tests/. CONTRACTS.md was checked against PLAN.md sections 4–8 and the DUR-002 acceptance text.
- Checks personally run (Claude, 2026-09-16). All ran in a scratch export (`git archive 5184a3d`) outside the repository unless noted:
  - `scripts/ci.ps1 -WithRace`: PASS (gofmt, go vet, go test, go build, ruff check/format, strict mypy on 8 files, 7 pytest tests, `go test -race ./...`).
  - Failure propagation: an injected failing pytest (`assert value == 2`) made `ci.ps1` exit 1 with "Python tests failed."; an injected `t.Fatal` Go test made `ci.ps1` exit 1. Injected files were removed from the scratch copy.
  - `tests/test_fault_control.py` repeated 25 times: 25/25 PASS.
  - Partition vectors recomputed independently with `sha256sum` (a third implementation): all four committed vectors match; three of them have the top bit set, so signed/unsigned and byte-order mistakes would be caught. Probed extra IDs through the committed Go and Python code: `wf-é-日本` → 3 in both; invalid UTF-8 `wf-\xff\xfe` → Go returns 8, Python raises `UnicodeEncodeError` (R007).
  - Fault-controller probe script (scratch only): a target killed before reporting its boundary, and a target that prints one non-JSON line before a valid boundary report, both produced `['process_started', 'boundary_timeout']`; the non-JSON case also killed the reader thread with `JSONDecodeError` (R005). A normal release trace contained no target acknowledgement (R006).
  - `scripts/smoke.ps1` against the already-running local services, from the repository root (read-only): PASS. PostgreSQL 18.6 with data_checksums/fsync/synchronous_commit/full_page_writes all `on`; both Kafka topics present; two runtimes, two workers, OpenTelemetry, and Prometheus healthy; both runtimes scraped. `git status` stayed clean afterwards.
- Codex-reported checks considered but not rerun by Claude: `scripts/bootstrap.ps1 -StartServices` from a clean state, `scripts/restart-smoke.ps1` (not rerun because it force-recreates the shared local containers), and the `faults.control` CLI release/timeout runs (the equivalent code paths were covered by the pytest runs and the probe).
- Deferred P2 findings, if any: none.
- Remaining P3 findings / uncertainties / untested areas: P3 findings R006, R007, R008, R009. Untested: clean-machine bootstrap, and data surviving an unclean container kill (the restart smoke uses a graceful `--force-recreate`, which is enough for DUR-001 but is not crash evidence). No remote CI exists. `-WithServices` runs health checks only; no PostgreSQL/Kafka integration test exists yet (acceptable at M0 because no engine code exists, but `ci.ps1` should say so explicitly; see R008).
- Limitations: Windows host only; PowerShell 5.1 (`pwsh` unavailable). Docker checks used the containers already running on this host rather than a fresh bootstrap. The `.pytest_cache` ACL warning Codex reported probably comes from host-level Codex sandbox file ownership (on this host the repo's `.git` was owned by the `CodexSandboxOffline` account); it is an environment issue, not a repository defect.
- Verdict: CHANGES_REQUESTED. Blocking: R001, R002, R003, R004, R005 (all P2).

For each round, record:

## Findings

### R001 — Protected-scope PLAN.md changes were committed without a recorded user decision

- Severity: P2
- Status: ADDRESSED
- Deferred: no
- Reviewed commit: `87e123a`
- Location: PLAN.md:3, PLAN.md:49-50 (new RQ7/RQ8), section 10 release definitions (Portfolio MVP / Full v1), PLAN.md:615 (DUR-029 rescoped), PLAN.md:763 onward (live-model and adversarial studies); docs/DECISIONS.md (only D001–D004 exist).
- Failure scenario and impact: PLAN.md section 1 and CLAUDE.md forbid changing guarantees, release criteria, experiment families, paid budgets, or deferred scope without an explicit user decision recorded in `docs/DECISIONS.md`. `87e123a` commits a large scope change with no such record:
  - new research questions RQ7 (retrieval strategy) and RQ8 (defense profile / injection);
  - new MCP, pgvector, full-text-search, and Grafana stack items;
  - a separate retrieval benchmark (≥40 development + ≥120 held-out queries);
  - Portfolio MVP and Full v1 release criteria that now require these;
  - live-model volume raised from "20 × 2 = 40 executions" to a 60-execution retrieval-arm study plus a 120-execution adversarial ablation, which raises the planned paid model spend while the cap is still unset (PLAN.md:417).

  Git status at the start of this session already showed these PLAN.md edits uncommitted on top of `198fd4b`, and the handoff says "Existing PLAN changes were preserved", so they are most likely user-authored. Even so, nothing traceable shows the change was authorized. Future reviews cannot tell authorized scope from drift, and the expanded paid volume has no recorded basis.
- Evidence: `git diff 198fd4b 87e123a -- PLAN.md` (92+/32− in the scope-bearing sections beyond the M0 status edits); `docs/DECISIONS.md` at `87e123a` contains only D001–D004, none of which covers the scope change.
- Suggested correction: The user confirms authorship of the scope change. Codex then records it as a decision (e.g. `D005 — Retrieval/MCP/adversarial scope expansion`) in `docs/DECISIONS.md`, listing:
  - the added research questions, experiment families, and release-criteria changes;
  - the revised live-model execution counts;
  - a statement that paid caps remain unset and must be approved before DUR-029;
  - the alternatives considered.

  If the user did not author any part of the change, revert that part instead.
- Suggested validation: Claude checks that D005 covers every protected-scope change in `git diff 198fd4b 87e123a -- PLAN.md` and that the user's authorization is stated.

#### Codex response 鈥?round 2

- Change made or reason for disagreement: The user confirmed authorship and authorization of the pre-existing PLAN.md changes. Added D005 to `docs/DECISIONS.md`, covering RQ7/RQ8, the retrieval/MCP/pgvector/full-text/Grafana scope, the revised release criteria, the 40-development/120-held-out retrieval benchmark, the 60 live retrieval-arm executions, and the 120-execution adversarial study. D005 explicitly keeps paid execution and its spending cap subject to separate approval before DUR-029 and records the deferred-scope alternatives considered.
- Fix commit: pending exact commit ID after this documentation change is committed
- Tests and results: Reviewed D005 against the protected-scope locations listed in R001. No model or paid-provider execution was performed or authorized by D005.
- Status: ADDRESSED

### R002 — CONTRACTS.md state machine contradicts PLAN.md and omits required states

- Severity: P2
- Status: ADDRESSED
- Deferred: no
- Reviewed commit: `87e123a`
- Location: docs/CONTRACTS.md:44-76 (state diagram), docs/CONTRACTS.md:114.
- Failure scenario and impact: DUR-002 says contradictions become blocking findings, and M1 (DUR-005) will build its schema directly from this frozen contract. Defects in the frozen contract:
  1. **Cooperating and non-cooperating sinks are not distinguished.** The diagram sends every "ambiguous external outcome" to `RECONCILIATION_REQUIRED`, and the ambiguous-effect trace (line 114) gives that outcome with no sink distinction. PLAN.md:146 and PLAN.md:287 say a lost response from the *cooperating* sink is resolved by retrying with the same effect key and reusing the stored receipt, or by a receipt lookup; only the non-cooperating endpoint (PLAN.md:321) requires reconciliation. A schema/state machine built from this contract would either send every cooperating-sink timeout to manual reconciliation, which breaks the cooperating-sink guarantee and the F-campaign expectations, or depart from the frozen contract.
  2. **Every accepted result passes through `WAITING_TIMER`.** The diagram's only path to `SUCCEEDED/FAILED` goes through `WAITING_TIMER`, so a successful activity would need a timer before completing. There is also no path from an accepted result back to scheduling the next node of a multi-node workflow.
  3. **No approval-wait state.** PLAN.md:325-333 requires a durable approval wait that holds no lock or worker slot, plus a dispatch-grant step.
  4. **No attempt state machine.** DUR-002 scope requires "workflow/attempt state diagrams". PLAN.md:179 defines attempt dispatch state, claim, heartbeat deadline, and terminal outcome, but no attempt lifecycle (e.g. created → dispatchable → claimed → succeeded/failed/timed-out/replaced/outcome-unknown) is given.
  5. **`RECONCILIATION_REQUIRED` has no exits** and is not classified as terminal or non-terminal. PLAN.md:321 allows audited operator resolve/abandon, and it is unclear whether "any non-terminal state → CANCELED" applies to it.
  6. **No state for unsupported versions.** PLAN.md:203 requires an explicit paused state with a reason.
- Evidence: the diagram at docs/CONTRACTS.md:44-76 and the line-114 trace, compared with PLAN.md:146, 179, 203, 287, 321, 325-333.
- Suggested correction: Revise the workflow diagram to:
  - add a scheduling loop for later nodes, a direct accepted-result → completion edge, and retry-backoff as the only use of `WAITING_TIMER`;
  - add `WAITING_APPROVAL`, the unsupported-version paused state, and `RECONCILIATION_REQUIRED` exits (audited resolve/abandon), with terminal/non-terminal status stated for each state.

  Also:
  - add an attempt state diagram;
  - split the ambiguous-effect outcome into cooperating (same-key retry or receipt lookup; reconciliation only if the lookup is itself unavailable past policy) and non-cooperating (`RECONCILIATION_REQUIRED`, no automatic retry);
  - bump the contract version, or note the change as a pre-freeze correction, before DUR-005 begins.
- Suggested validation: Claude re-walks every PLAN.md section 4–8 guarantee against the revised diagrams. No state or transition used by those sections should be missing or contradicted.

#### Codex response – round 2

- Change made or reason for disagreement: Replaced the v1 draft with `dur-002.v2` in `docs/CONTRACTS.md`. The workflow diagram now distinguishes retry/backoff timers from accepted results, includes `WAITING_APPROVAL`, `PAUSED_UNSUPPORTED_VERSION`, `RECONCILIATION_REQUIRED` exits, terminal `ABANDONED`, and direct next-node scheduling. Added the complete attempt lifecycle and cooperating versus non-cooperating effect recovery semantics.
- Fix commit: `ed62eca`
- Tests and results: `docs/CONTRACTS.md` was cross-checked against the cited PLAN sections; the Go/Python check suite passes.
- Status: ADDRESSED

### R003 — Required race walkthroughs lack per-ordering outcomes, transaction boundaries, and durable-record locations

- Severity: P2
- Status: ADDRESSED
- Deferred: no
- Reviewed commit: `87e123a`
- Location: docs/CONTRACTS.md:107-115 ("Required ordering traces").
- Failure scenario and impact: DUR-002 acceptance requires "one explicit outcome per ordering", and its validation requires "paper traces [that] include transaction boundaries and the location of every durable record". The committed traces are one-line table rows:
  - **Worker timeout/result race** (line 112) and **approval/cancellation race** (line 115) say only "one lock/serialized winner is recorded", without the outcome for each winner. They do not say, for example: timeout first → attempt replaced and late result rejected with no state change; result first → result accepted and timeout is a no-op. For approval/cancellation, PLAN.md:333 draws a specific boundary: cancellation before the durable dispatch grant prevents dispatch; after the grant it is best effort, and the effect may still apply. The trace does not state that.
  - **Scheduler handoff** (line 111) covers only "A starts a new write after B's takeover". It omits the ordering PLAN.md:224 calls out: A's transaction validated ownership before expiry and still holds the lease row lock while B tries to acquire it. There, A commits and B waits and then gets a higher epoch.
  - **Outbox duplicate** (line 113) omits the relay crash *before* broker acknowledgement (relay-claim expiry → republish), and never says where the consumer's idempotent disposition (event inbox) is stored or when the Kafka offset is committed relative to it.
  - **No trace shows** which transaction writes which rows (workflow, attempt, history, outbox, inbox, effect ledger, approval intent), or which store — engine database, effect-service ledger, or Kafka — holds each record at each step.

  With these gaps, DUR-005 through DUR-016 would each resolve these orderings ad hoc, which is the ambiguity the M0 contract freeze was meant to remove.
- Evidence: docs/CONTRACTS.md:107-115 against the DUR-002 acceptance/validation text and PLAN.md:224, 236-240, 248-250, 259, 269, 333.
- Suggested correction: Expand each of the six scenarios into a numbered step trace. For each step, record the actor and the transaction boundary (BEGIN/COMMIT), the rows locked/written and their store, and the durable outcome for **each** ordering of the racing operations. Include the orderings listed above. A per-scenario subsection or a `docs/PROTOCOLS.md` companion (PLAN.md section 11) are both acceptable.
- Suggested validation: Claude checks each trace for a complete ordering list and a single outcome per ordering. It also cross-checks that every durable record mentioned exists in the PLAN.md section 5 data model.

#### Codex response – round 2

- Change made or reason for disagreement: Expanded all six traces in `docs/CONTRACTS.md` into numbered per-ordering walkthroughs. They now identify BEGIN/COMMIT boundaries, EDB/K/EL record locations, the lock-held scheduler handoff, both timeout/result winners, pre-ack and post-ack outbox crashes, cooperating/non-cooperating effect outcomes, and cancellation before versus after the approval grant.
- Fix commit: `ed62eca`
- Tests and results: The revised contract was reviewed against PLAN.md sections 5-8; the Go/Python check suite passes.
- Status: ADDRESSED

### R004 — DUR-003 has no reusable failpoint API, seeded workflow fixtures, or fake activities; the seed has no effect

- Severity: P2
- Status: ADDRESSED
- Deferred: no
- Reviewed commit: `87e123a`
- Location: python/faults/control.py:74-87 (the command is hard-coded to `-m faults.target`), python/faults/target.py:28, tests/test_fault_control.py:53-61.
- Failure scenario and impact: DUR-003 scope is "Seeded workflow fixtures, fake activities, named barrier/failpoint API, controller process, trace schema". The goal is to make failures reproducible *before the engine grows*. The committed harness:
  - **can only drive its own toy process.** No library exists that the Go runtime or a Python worker could call to declare a named failpoint and block on the controller, and the controller cannot launch any other command. The first scheduler/worker crash tests (M1/M2, most of which are Go-side) therefore have no failpoint mechanism, so the M0 gate is met in name only.
  - **has no seeded workflow fixture or fake activity.**
  - **uses the seed for nothing except `sha256(seed:boundary)`** (target.py:28). `test_same_seed_repeats_same_boundary_trace` therefore passes by construction.
  - **never repeats a crash.** DUR-003 validation asks to "repeat one controlled crash with the same seed", but the repeated test (lines 53-61) repeats a *release*; the kill path runs once and checks no trace stability.
- Evidence: code references above; `git grep -n failpoint 87e123a` finds no Go code; the controller accepts only `--seed/--boundary/--skip-boundary` for the fixed target.
- Suggested correction: Either (a) or (b):
  - **(a) Implement the missing scope minimally:**
    - a failpoint client in both Go (`internal/faults` or similar) and Python that reads a controller channel from the environment, reports `boundary_reached`, and blocks on release/kill;
    - a controller that launches an arbitrary target command;
    - a small seeded fixture generator (seed → deterministic workflow definition and fake activity inputs/outcomes) plus one fake activity that hits a named failpoint;
    - a test that repeats the *kill* scenario with the same seed and compares normalized traces.
  - **(b) Split out the missing items:** record them as an explicit named subtask (e.g. DUR-003B) with a user-approved decision and a dependency before the first M1/M2 crash test. DUR-003 is then accepted only for the delivered subset.
- Suggested validation: A Go test process and a Python test process each stop at a named failpoint under the controller and are killed there. Two runs with the same seed produce identical normalized traces, and a different seed changes the fixture-derived fields.

#### Codex response – round 2

- Change made or reason for disagreement: Added reusable environment-configured failpoint clients in `internal/faults` and `python/faults/client.py`, an arbitrary-command TCP controller, seeded Python fixtures/fake activity, and `cmd/fault-fixture` for Go. The tests repeat the actual kill scenario with the same seed and assert that a different seed changes fixture fields.
- Fix commit: `ed62eca`
- Tests and results: `tests/test_fault_control.py` passes 7/7, including Python and Go targets, repeated kills, release/acknowledgement, early exit, noisy output, and heavy stderr.
- Status: ADDRESSED

### R005 — Fault controller reports target crashes and protocol errors as "boundary not reached"

- Severity: P2
- Status: ADDRESSED
- Deferred: no
- Reviewed commit: `87e123a`
- Location: python/faults/control.py:33-37, 100-114, 116-134.
- Failure scenario and impact: The trace exists to prove *where* a fault happened. Two paths produce false evidence:
  1. **Target exits before its boundary** (startup crash, import error, bad arguments). `wait_for_boundary` waits the full timeout, then records only `boundary_timeout`, with no process-exit event before it. The trace cannot distinguish "the target never reached the boundary because it crashed" from "the target hung".
  2. **Any non-JSON line on the target's stdout** (a log line, a warning) makes `json.loads` raise inside the daemon reader thread. The thread dies silently and all later output is ignored. A boundary that *was* reached is then recorded as `boundary_timeout`. JSON that decodes to a non-object is handled, but invalid JSON is not.

  Real engine processes print logs, so once R004 wires them in, the second case becomes likely. Campaign traces would then report "not reached" for faults that were injected, a harness-sensitivity failure. `stderr` is also piped but never read, so a target that writes a lot to stderr can block on a full pipe and look like a timeout.
- Evidence: Claude's scratch probe (not committed): a killed target gave `result None waited 2.00s events ['process_started', 'boundary_timeout']`; a target printing `starting up` and then a valid `boundary_reached` gave `events ['process_started', 'boundary_timeout']`, plus a `JSONDecodeError` traceback from `_read_output`.
- Suggested correction:
  - **Separate the protocol channel from stdout.** Use a dedicated channel (a pipe or socket handed to the target), or prefix protocol lines and ignore/record everything else instead of raising.
  - **Keep the reader thread alive.** Catch decode errors and record a `protocol_error` or `target_output` event.
  - **Report early exits.** Have `wait_for_boundary` also notice process exit (e.g. put a sentinel on the queue when stdout reaches EOF) and record `process_exited_before_boundary` with the return code.
  - **Drain stderr.** Read it into the trace or a log file.
- Suggested validation: Tests covering (a) target exits before the boundary → a distinct trace event returned before the timeout; (b) non-JSON output before the boundary → boundary still detected; (c) heavy stderr output does not block.

#### Codex response – round 2

- Change made or reason for disagreement: Moved the control protocol to a dedicated loopback channel, leaving stdout/stderr as drained logs. Protocol decode errors are recorded without killing the reader. Process monitoring reports `process_exited_before_boundary` with the return code, and boundary timeouts are reserved for a live target that never reports the boundary.
- Fix commit: `ed62eca`
- Tests and results: Tests cover early exit, non-protocol stdout, 2,000 stderr lines, and normal boundary detection; the full check suite passes.
- Status: ADDRESSED

### R006 — Fault traces lack the target's acknowledgement and are rewritten non-atomically

- Severity: P3
- Status: ADDRESSED
- Deferred: no
- Reviewed commit: `87e123a`
- Location: python/faults/control.py:52-65, 108-114, 144-147; python/faults/target.py:46-53.
- Failure scenario and impact:
  - **Release is never confirmed by the target.** The target emits `released` after it receives the release command, but the reader drops every event except `boundary_reached`. A release trace therefore shows only the controller's command and an exit code, not that the target resumed past the boundary.
  - **The trace file can be lost mid-run.** `_record` rewrites the whole JSONL file on every event, so a controller crash mid-write can truncate the evidence of earlier events. Appending plus flushing would keep the earlier lines.
  - **`pause()` does nothing but record.** The target is already blocked, so "pause" here means "hold at the barrier". That is acceptable, but the docs should say so, and no test shows the target stays held (e.g. no `released` event before the release command).
- Evidence: code references above; the probe's release trace was `['process_started', 'boundary_reached', 'command', 'process_exited']`.
- Suggested correction: Record the target's `released` acknowledgement, and add an assertion that it arrives only after the release command. Append-and-flush the JSONL trace instead of rewriting it. Document the semantics of `pause`.
- Suggested validation: The release test asserts the order `command(release)` → `released` → `process_exited`, and a truncated-write simulation keeps all earlier records.

#### Codex response – round 2

- Change made or reason for disagreement: The controller now records the target's `released` protocol event, tests pause → release → acknowledgement → exit ordering, and appends/flushed/fsyncs each JSONL trace record rather than rewriting the whole file. `pause()` is documented as holding the already-reported barrier.
- Fix commit: `ed62eca`
- Tests and results: The release test validates monotonic trace sequences and parseable appended records; the full check suite passes.
- Status: ADDRESSED

### R007 — Go and Python partition implementations disagree on invalid UTF-8; vectors are duplicated and lack a non-ASCII case

- Severity: P3
- Status: ADDRESSED
- Deferred: no
- Reviewed commit: `87e123a`
- Location: internal/partition/partition.go:21-26; python/durable_contracts/partition.py:18-24; docs/partition-map-v1.md; internal/partition/partition_test.go; tests/test_partition_vectors.py.
- Failure scenario and impact: The contract says workflow IDs are non-empty UTF-8 strings.
  - **Invalid UTF-8 is accepted in Go only.** Go hashes any byte string, so `"wf-\xff\xfe"` → partition 8, while Python cannot encode the equivalent (surrogate-escaped) string and raises `UnicodeEncodeError`. If an API layer ever passes raw bytes through, the Go and Python implementations disagree instead of both rejecting the input.
  - **The vectors are defined in three places.** They are copied into the doc, the Go test, and the Python test, with no shared vector file, so a future edit can drift in one place.
  - **Non-ASCII input is never tested**, although it is part of the UTF-8 contract. Claude checked that `wf-é-日本` → 3 in both implementations.
- Evidence: Claude's scratch Go/Python probe results in Round 1.
- Suggested correction: In Go, reject IDs where `!utf8.ValidString(workflowID)`. Move the vectors into one checked-in file (e.g. `api/partition-map-v1.vectors.json`) that both test suites load, and add at least one non-ASCII vector and one invalid-UTF-8 rejection case.
- Suggested validation: Both suites load the shared vector file, pass, and reject invalid UTF-8.

#### Codex response – round 2

- Change made or reason for disagreement: Go now rejects invalid UTF-8 explicitly. The duplicated vectors moved to `api/partition-map-v1.vectors.json`, both suites load that file, and it includes the non-ASCII `wf-é-日本` case plus separate invalid-UTF-8 rejection tests.
- Fix commit: `ed62eca`
- Tests and results: Go partition tests and Python partition tests pass in the full check suite.
- Status: ADDRESSED

### R008 — Scaffold issues that will break or mislead in DUR-005

- Severity: P3
- Status: ADDRESSED
- Deferred: no
- Reviewed commit: `198fd4b` (unchanged at `87e123a`)
- Location: deploy/local/Dockerfile.runtime:3-5; scripts/migrate.ps1:9-14; scripts/ci.ps1:21-26.
- Failure scenario and impact:
  1. **The runtime image will stop building.** Dockerfile.runtime copies only `go.mod` and `cmd/`. As soon as `cmd/runtime` imports `internal/...` (e.g. `internal/partition`) or gains a `go.sum`, `docker compose up --build` fails.
  2. **Migrations are re-run every time.** `migrate.ps1` replays every `*.up.sql` file on each bootstrap and never checks `engine.schema_migrations`. That works only while every migration is idempotent; the first non-idempotent DUR-005 migration (e.g. `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN`) fails or double-applies on the next bootstrap.
  3. **The service check overstates its coverage.** DUR-004 scope lists "real database/Kafka integration", but `-WithServices` runs health checks only. The acceptance criterion requires unimplemented checks to be reported explicitly, and `ci.ps1` does not say that integration tests do not exist yet.
- Evidence: file contents at the listed lines.
- Suggested correction: Copy `internal/` (and `go.sum` once it exists) into the build stage. Make `migrate.ps1` skip versions already recorded in `engine.schema_migrations`, with each migration recording its own version. Have `ci.ps1 -WithServices` print that PostgreSQL/Kafka integration tests are not yet implemented, until they are.
- Suggested validation: After DUR-005 adds a non-idempotent migration, run `bootstrap.ps1 -StartServices` twice. Build the runtime image with an `internal/` import.

#### Codex response – round 2

- Change made or reason for disagreement: `Dockerfile.runtime` now copies `internal/`. `migrate.ps1` inspects `engine.schema_migrations`, skips recorded versions, and verifies a newly applied migration records its numeric filename version. `ci.ps1 -WithServices` explicitly states that M0 has no PostgreSQL/Kafka integration tests and runs service health/durability smoke checks only.
- Fix commit: `ed62eca`
- Tests and results: Post-fix bootstrap rebuilt both runtime images and passed health/migration smoke; the migration script reported `Skipping already applied 000001_bootstrap.up.sql`; restart smoke and `ci.ps1 -WithRace -WithServices` passed.
- Status: ADDRESSED

### R009 — Handoff base commit excludes the DUR-001 implementation it claims to hand off

- Severity: P3
- Status: ADDRESSED
- Deferred: no
- Reviewed commit: `5184a3d`
- Location: REVIEW.md "Codex handoff" (`Base commit: 198fd4b`); docs/BUILD_LOG.md.
- Failure scenario and impact: The handoff scope is "DUR-001 through DUR-004", but DUR-001 was implemented *in* `198fd4b`. A reviewer diffing `198fd4b..87e123a`, as declared, would never see the DUR-001 scaffold (Compose, Dockerfiles, scripts, runtime/worker stubs, migrations), which had not been reviewed before. That is a mismatch between the handoff declaration and the repository state.
- Evidence: `git show --stat 198fd4b` (37 files, including all DUR-001 scaffolding); the previous REVIEW.md said "No review performed yet."
- Suggested correction: In future handoffs, set the base to the last *reviewed* commit (here `d722cf7`), or list per-task base/target commits. This round already reviewed `d722cf7..87e123a` for DUR-001, so no further action is needed for M0 beyond correcting the handoff field on the next update.
- Suggested validation: The next handoff's base commit matches the last reviewed commit.

#### Codex response – round 2

- Change made or reason for disagreement: The next handoff will use `d722cf7`, the last reviewed planning baseline, as the base and will identify the new fixed target commit explicitly. The original scaffold remains in the review range rather than being implicitly excluded.
- Fix commit: `ed62eca`
- Tests and results: The current review response records the corrected base policy; final commit hashes will be filled after this fix pass is committed.
- Status: ADDRESSED
